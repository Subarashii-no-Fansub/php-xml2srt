00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The Web may seem like a vast ocean when it comes to finding something you need.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thankfully, search engines can help turn oceans of information into small pools

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
that make finding information easier.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is Web Search Strategies in Plain English.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Before we dive in,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's talk a bit about how search works on the Web.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Search engines go out and try to account for every word on every web page.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All this information is then organized for easy reference.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When you search for a word, the search engine finds all the pages where the word appears, 

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and displays them in the search results.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Usually, the pages that appear highest in the search results have lots of other web pages linking to them.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Each link acts as a vote to say, "This may be a good resource."

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The problem is that there are often too many results.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You need a way to reduce the number of results so you can find what you need.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's look at how this works.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Say you're looking for a specific kind of fish, and these represent all the websites on the Web.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Searching for FISH doesn't help much. There are way too many results. You need to be more specific.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Try to imagine the exact fish and describe it in the search box.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You'll see that each word you use gets you closer to what you need.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can do this for any website by imagining the website that has your answer.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's the title of the page? What words appear on it?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If you put those words in the search box, you'll get closer to finding answers.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But to be a smart searcher, you should know some basic shortcuts.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's say you're looking for words that appear together, like a phrase or a quote.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
An example is a search for information on sand sharks.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If you search for it like this, the search engine looks for pages with SAND and SHARKS. 

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
To get better results, put quotes around the words like this.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It limits the results to the exact phrase.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Here's another shortcut. Words often have multiple meanings.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Consider the word MULLET, which is both a fish and a hairstyle.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A search for MULLET may give you a number of results about the hairstyle, but fewer about the fish.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
To remove the results about hair place a hyphen or minus sign just before the word you want to exclude,

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
which means, "show me the pages about mullet, but take away results relating to hair."

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
By being specific, and using words and symbols that remove useless information,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
you can find exactly what you need, and keep the Web from swallowing you whole.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
