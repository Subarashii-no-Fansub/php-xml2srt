      <p begin="00:00:36.411">(Jill Beauchamp)&lt;br&gt;I believe that our program here</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.153">at Washtenaw Community College&lt;br&gt;in Culinary and Hospitality</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.314">is the program of choice&lt;br&gt;in southeastern Michigan.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.005">I know that&apos;s pretty bold,&lt;br&gt;but I just think that</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.748">if a student wants to learn&lt;br&gt;both theory and practice,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.894">we will allow for that.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.446">The students are another&lt;br&gt;huge strength of our program.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.152">(Andrew Willis)&lt;br&gt;I&apos;ve worked in restaurants</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.935">on and off&lt;br&gt;pretty much my whole life.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.735">I&apos;ve worked in the back&lt;br&gt;of the house, the front</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.824">of the house, I&apos;ve done&lt;br&gt;other things in my career</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.068">and just came back to&lt;br&gt;what I love.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.993">(Cassondra Curtis)&lt;br&gt;I feel that I&apos;m getting a lot</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.556">out of this program.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.949">Not only some great friends&lt;br&gt;and a great education,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.235">great experience, but just&lt;br&gt;memories that I can have</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.002">for the rest of my life.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.293">(Jill Beauchamp)&lt;br&gt;Garrett&apos;s Restaurant is a full</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.886">service laboratory classroom,&lt;br&gt;where the students learn</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.092">the art of giving good service&lt;br&gt;while taking the course work</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.704">along with it.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.011">(Cassondra Curtis)&lt;br&gt;You actually get to run</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.119">a restaurant.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.717">I know a lot of colleges that&lt;br&gt;have culinary classes, but when</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.788">I tell them about ours,&lt;br&gt;they&apos;re like,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.559">&quot;Wow, that would be so cool.&quot;&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.859">[Latin music playing]&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.630">(Zachary Hintalla)&lt;br&gt;For the past two years,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.883">my most memorable experiences&lt;br&gt;have both dealt with working</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.470">at Mardi Gras.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.142">It&apos;s a blast each year.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.317">(Carol Deinzer)&lt;br&gt;Mardi Gras is</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.356">an annual fundraiser at the&lt;br&gt;College for the</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.631">general scholarship fund.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.163">It&apos;s a huge opportunity&lt;br&gt;for our students.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.352">Not only do they get real-life&lt;br&gt;experience with serving</p>
      <p begin="00:02:24.172">hundred&apos;s of people, they also&lt;br&gt;get the opportunity to work</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.711">with chefs from the outside,&lt;br&gt;which just is invaluable.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.104">(Jill Beauchamp)&lt;br&gt;The most important factor,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:37.540">of course, is the instruction.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:38.794">I think we have&lt;br&gt;top-notch instructors,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.780">both full time and part time.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:42.869">(Cassondra Curtis)&lt;br&gt;My instructors are actually</p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.411">very wonderful.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.004">They are really&lt;br&gt;down-to-earth people,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.997">and it makes it so much easier&lt;br&gt;to ask questions and be open</p>
      <p begin="00:02:51.142">and even to be a little silly&lt;br&gt;at times.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:54.520">(Andrew Willis)&lt;br&gt;The instructors are just</p>
      <p begin="00:02:55.878">relentless.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.244">They&apos;re so tough.&lt;br&gt;I mean, I can&apos;t...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.888">I&apos;m just kidding.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.188">(Terri Herrera)&lt;br&gt;I feel I have to get in</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.464">with the students&lt;br&gt;instead of standing</p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.210">over lecturing.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:03:04.905">I have to do it,&lt;br&gt;be involved with them.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:07.500">And I feel as though I&lt;br&gt;get the most out of my students</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.388">when I teach that way.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:12.398">(Paul McPherson)&lt;br&gt;I think what&apos;s important</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.555">about our program&lt;br&gt;is some of the opportunities</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.391">that it presents itself,&lt;br&gt;not only a few</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.213">of our specialty classes,&lt;br&gt;but the individualized attention</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.851">that our students get here -&lt;br&gt;the counseling and the advice</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.564">and just the dedication&lt;br&gt;from faculty.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.831">(Terri Herrera)&lt;br&gt;I still feel as though I&apos;m part</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.602">of their lives because, hey,&lt;br&gt;I talked to you,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:33.002">I trained you.&lt;br&gt;I feel like they&apos;re my children.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:40.234">It&apos;s just a passion that I have&lt;br&gt;for teaching.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:44.680">(Paul McPherson)&lt;br&gt;There&apos;s always an excitement</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.167">about being a chef&lt;br&gt;or being a pastry chef</p>
      <p begin="00:03:50.448">and being involved&lt;br&gt;in a very active industry.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.086">(Gena Parker)&lt;br&gt;I feel that I will be sought</p>
      <p begin="00:03:54.569">after I&apos;m done&lt;br&gt;with this program</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.083">because I&apos;ve learned so much.&lt;br&gt;</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.468">I have qualities,&lt;br&gt;I have confidence in myself</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.956">because of the program&lt;br&gt;and what I&apos;ve learned.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:02.752">(Zachary Hintalla)&lt;br&gt;The instruction here</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.535">has definitely prepared me&lt;br&gt;to move on to what I&apos;d like</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.278">to do later on in life:&lt;br&gt;to run my own restaurant.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:09.726">(Jill Beauchamp)&lt;br&gt;When I see a student</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.595">find a career&lt;br&gt;that they&apos;re</p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.159">passionate about,&lt;br&gt;that is the</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.259" dur="2041ms">greatest source of pride for me.&lt;br&gt;</p>
