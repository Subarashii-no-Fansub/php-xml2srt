00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,209
[Latin music playing]<br>

2
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:36,411
(Jill Beauchamp)<br>I believe that our program here

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,153
at Washtenaw Community College<br>in Culinary and Hospitality

4
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:42,314
is the program of choice<br>in southeastern Michigan.

5
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:45,005
I know that's pretty bold,<br>but I just think that

6
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,748
if a student wants to learn<br>both theory and practice,

7
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:52,894
we will allow for that.<br>

8
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:56,446
The students are another<br>huge strength of our program.

9
00:00:56,446 --> 00:01:00,152
(Andrew Willis)<br>I've worked in restaurants

10
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:01,935
on and off<br>pretty much my whole life.

11
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:03,735
I've worked in the back<br>of the house, the front

12
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,824
of the house, I've done<br>other things in my career

13
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:09,068
and just came back to<br>what I love.

14
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,993
(Cassondra Curtis)<br>I feel that I'm getting a lot

15
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:12,556
out of this program.<br>

16
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:13,949
Not only some great friends<br>and a great education,

17
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,235
great experience, but just<br>memories that I can have

18
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:21,002
for the rest of my life.<br>

19
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:23,293
(Jill Beauchamp)<br>Garrett's Restaurant is a full

20
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:25,886
service laboratory classroom,<br>where the students learn

21
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:30,092
the art of giving good service<br>while taking the course work

22
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:32,704
along with it.<br>

23
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:34,011
(Cassondra Curtis)<br>You actually get to run

24
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,119
a restaurant.<br>

25
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,717
I know a lot of colleges that<br>have culinary classes, but when

26
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:41,788
I tell them about ours,<br>they're like,

27
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:43,559
"Wow, that would be so cool."<br>

28
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:46,859
[Latin music playing]<br>

29
00:01:46,859 --> 00:02:07,630
(Zachary Hintalla)<br>For the past two years,

30
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,883
my most memorable experiences<br>have both dealt with working

31
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:11,470
at Mardi Gras.<br>

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,142
It's a blast each year.<br>

33
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:14,317
(Carol Deinzer)<br>Mardi Gras is

34
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:15,356
an annual fundraiser at the<br>College for the

35
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:16,631
general scholarship fund.<br>

36
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:18,163
It's a huge opportunity<br>for our students.

37
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:20,352
Not only do they get real-life<br>experience with serving

38
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:24,172
hundred's of people, they also<br>get the opportunity to work

39
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:28,711
with chefs from the outside,<br>which just is invaluable.

40
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:35,104
(Jill Beauchamp)<br>The most important factor,

41
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:37,540
of course, is the instruction.<br>

42
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,794
I think we have<br>top-notch instructors,

43
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:40,780
both full time and part time.<br>

44
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,869
(Cassondra Curtis)<br>My instructors are actually

45
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:44,411
very wonderful.<br>

46
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,004
They are really<br>down-to-earth people,

47
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:46,997
and it makes it so much easier<br>to ask questions and be open

48
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:51,142
and even to be a little silly<br>at times.

49
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:54,520
(Andrew Willis)<br>The instructors are just

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,878
relentless.<br>

51
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:56,244
They're so tough.<br>I mean, I can't...

52
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,888
I'm just kidding.

53
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,188
(Terri Herrera)<br>I feel I have to get in

54
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:01,464
with the students<br>instead of standing

55
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:03,210
over lecturing.<br>

56
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,905
I have to do it,<br>be involved with them.

57
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:07,500
And I feel as though I<br>get the most out of my students

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,388
when I teach that way.

59
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:12,398
(Paul McPherson)<br>I think what's important

60
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,555
about our program<br>is some of the opportunities

61
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:15,391
that it presents itself,<br>not only a few

62
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:18,213
of our specialty classes,<br>but the individualized attention

63
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:20,851
that our students get here -<br>the counseling and the advice

64
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:24,564
and just the dedication<br>from faculty.

65
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:27,831
(Terri Herrera)<br>I still feel as though I'm part

66
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:29,602
of their lives because, hey,<br>I talked to you,

67
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:33,002
I trained you.<br>I feel like they're my children.

68
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:40,234
It's just a passion that I have<br>for teaching.

69
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:44,680
(Paul McPherson)<br>There's always an excitement

70
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,167
about being a chef<br>or being a pastry chef

71
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:50,448
and being involved<br>in a very active industry.

72
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:53,086
(Gena Parker)<br>I feel that I will be sought

73
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:54,569
after I'm done<br>with this program

74
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,083
because I've learned so much.<br>

75
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,468
I have qualities,<br>I have confidence in myself

76
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:00,956
because of the program<br>and what I've learned.

77
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:02,752
(Zachary Hintalla)<br>The instruction here

78
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:03,535
has definitely prepared me<br>to move on to what I'd like

79
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,278
to do later on in life:<br>to run my own restaurant.

80
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:09,726
(Jill Beauchamp)<br>When I see a student

81
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:11,595
find a career<br>that they're

82
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:13,159
passionate about,<br>that is the

83
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,259
greatest source of pride for me.<br>
